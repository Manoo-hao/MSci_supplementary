This repository contains supplementary file towards my MSci thesis. Some 
of the necessary supplementary information is to large and unwieldy to 
attach directly to the document, yet, I believe, necessary for 
completeness of the thesis. You may ignore it for marking purposes if 
you wish.

#Content

###Supplementary methods 1:
List of R-studio packages including versions that were used at the time 
of data analysis.

###Supplementary methods 2:
R-studio code used for analysing flg22 application experimental data, 
and extract information about alpha-diversity, beta-diversity, and 
differential abundance.

###Supplementary methods 3:
R-studio code used for analysing BRI1 mutant experimental data, and 
extract information about diversity-indices and differential abundance

###Supplementary methods 4:
Procedure used for the extraction of the putative 
HvBAK gDNA sequence from the barley genome. R-studio code for converting 
gDNA sequence into cDNA sequence with annotated introns, compatible for 
designing intron-spanning primers via the Roche Assay Design center

###Supplementary results 1:
Full taxonomic information of enriched OTUs in the flg22 application 
experiment.

###Supplementary results 2:
Full taxonomic information of enriched OTUs in the <i>Hv</i>BRI mutant 
experiment
